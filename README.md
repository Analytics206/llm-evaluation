# LLM Evaluation Project

This project demonstrates how to evaluate a Large Language Model (LLM) using common metrics like **BLEU**, **ROUGE**, and **BERTScore**. It also includes scripts for loading a pre-trained model, generating responses, and evaluating the quality of generated text.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to:
- Load a pre-trained LLM (e.g., Hugging Face's `DialoGPT`).
- Generate responses to input prompts.
- Evaluate the quality of generated responses using metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore.
- Understand the strengths and limitations of these metrics.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/llm-evaluation.git
   cd llm-evaluation

python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
Prepare Test Data:
Add your input prompts and reference responses to data/test_data.json.
Run the Evaluation Pipeline:
python main.py
Check Results:
The evaluation results will be saved in results/evaluation_results.json.

## Evaluation Metrics
This project uses the following metrics to evaluate the model:

Metric	Description	Score Range
BLEU	Measures n-gram overlap between generated and reference texts.	0 to 1 (higher is better)
ROUGE	Measures word sequence overlap between generated and reference texts.	0 to 1 (higher is better)
BERTScore	Measures semantic similarity using embeddings from models like BERT.	0 to 1 (higher is better)
Perplexity	Measures how well the model predicts the next word in a sequence.	0 to ∞ (lower is better)
Limitations
Reference Quality:

Metrics assume the reference text is perfect. If the reference is flawed, the scores may be misleading.

Semantic Understanding:
Metrics like BLEU and ROUGE focus on word overlap, not semantic meaning. Use BERTScore for semantic evaluation.

Creativity:
Metrics may penalize creative or diverse responses that don’t match the reference text.
